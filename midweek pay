Borrowers perceive the loans to be a reasonable short-term choice but express surprise and frustration at how long it takes to pay them back. Seventy-eight percent of borrowers rely on lenders for accurate information, but the stated price tag for an average $375, two-week loan bears little resemblance to the actual cost of more than $500 over the five months of debt that the average user experiences. Desperation also influences the choice of 37 percent of borrowers who say they have been in such a difficult financial situation that they would take a payday loan on any terms offered.

More than half of payday loan borrowers have overdrafted in the past year. In addition, more than a quarter report that overdrafts occurred as a result of a payday lender making a withdrawal from their account. Although payday loans are often presented as an alternative to overdrafts, most payday borrowers end up paying fees for both.
